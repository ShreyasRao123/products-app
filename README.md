# Products Store / Charts page

This web page is Based on **React** and **Redux** JS frameworks and routing solution is implemented using **React Router**. 

The Presentation is done with **Bootstrap5** CSS Framework. 

Its Backend data requests are done by **AJAX** *fetch* method on a fake api.

The **Charts** page is based on **Apex Charts** framework

This *Single Page Web Application* provides following functionality:

- A Login Authentication / Registration Page, this is persistent even on refresh / closing - reopening of the page.
- Adding New Products
- Editing Existing Products
- Deleting Existing Products
- Sorting of Products
- Filtering of Products

Though the fake api doesnt support changes to its data, accomodation is made to temporarily display the changes reflecting actions like registering new users, adding, editing, deleting products etc. this may be lost on refresh

Thus this page effectively showcases my **frontend skills**.
